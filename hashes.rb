#hashes are like dictionaries --> they hold keys which are like words in a dictionary 
#and each of these keys has a value which is like the definition of the word 
#different from arrays, because in arrays, each element has an index (aka position) that is a number



celeb_crush = {} #how you create an empty hash 
#Way #1 to add someone to the hash 
celeb_crush["Maggie"] = "Zac Efron"
#create our first key and value. In this example, Maggie is the key, Zac Efron is the value 

#puts celeb_crush 
#print out the key and the value 

#Way #2 to add someone to our hash 
person_numero_dos = "Zoe"
crush = "Bruno Mars"
celeb_crush[person_numero_dos] = crush
